Simple JavaScript project introduction to AJAX requests
DO NOT use Google Chrome with this project as a CORS error will be thrown once the button click event triggers the AJAX request.
The local file does not provide the necessary protocol that Chrome only allows.
Use Mozilla Firefox or Safari if possible.
